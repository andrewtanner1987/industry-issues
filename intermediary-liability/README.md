# Intermediary liability

## What is it?

An internet intermediary is [a company that facilitiates the use of the Internet (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_intermediary). This includes companies that provide the network connection to the internet, such as internet service providers (ISPs), as well as those that provide online services such as search engines and social media platforms.

[Intermediary liability](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/focus-areas/intermediary-liability) is a legal concept which describes howliable an intermediary is for the content which it stores and transmits. Such content may be hate speech, copyright infringement, or images of abuse. Under some definitions of intermediary liability it would be possible for the owners and employees of intermediaries to be convicted of crimes for content which they personally have had nothing to do with - just because that content passed through their systems.

## Why is it important?

The last few decades have seen an explosion in worldwide communication, mainly due to the connectivity the internet affords. This communication has enabled education to reach those who could not previously access it, and allowed people in repressive regimes to organise and stand up for their human rights. However, this has also been an opportunity to spread illegal content.

So far intermediaries have not been held liable for the content stored in or transmitted through their systems. But global governments are increasingly vocal about the part intermediaries play in assisting with the policing of the internet. In some cases, legal sanctions have been threatened against intermediaries whose systems are used by those abusing their right to free speech.

Some people have made comparisons between internet intermediaries and other providers of communication or transit mechanisms, such as phone companies and highway agencies. They ask the question whether BT should be held liable for the telephone calls plotting terrorist actions that users make. Or whether Highways England have some responsibility to ensure that criminals using its roads to get away from a crime scene are stopped. These comparisons are only useful to a degree.

## What's happening with it?

The UK government has expressed the opinion that intermediaries should be held liable for the content in and moving through their systems. In particular, they have singled out Open Source software such as WordPress as well as communication platforms like Whatsapp and accused them of providing "a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other".

The government have suggested that intermediaries should remove extremist content within minutes of it going online, or even [stop it getting online in the first place](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/isis-propaganda-online-terrorists-extremists-encrypted-apps-attacks-whatsapp-telegram-amber-rudd-a7871866.html) but attempting a technological solution is fraught with pitfalls. Firstly that extremists and other bad actors will simple move onto other platforms where such controls are not in place - even [creating their own messaging app](http://www.newsweek.com/isis-creates-its-own-secure-messaging-app-415565). Secondly is the danger that legitimate content will be inadvertently (or even deliberately) targeted.

## The Web Matters position

While it is clear that there are huge problems to tackle online with regard to hate speech, counterfeiting, and a host of other crimes, intermediaries should not be held liable for the content of data travelling through or resting in their systems. Rather than relying on technological solutions which are error-prone
